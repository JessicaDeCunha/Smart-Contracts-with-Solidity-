Smart contracts to automate payroll

## Background 

Using Solidity to construct smart contracts, we are able to create multiple types of profit splitting contracts

## Contracts 

### First Contract: Associate Level 

The `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract accepts Ether into the contract and divides the Ether evenly among the recipient associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

### Second Contract: Tiered Level 
The `TieredProfitSplitter` contract distributes different percentages of incoming ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

### Third Contract: Equity Plan

The `DeferredEquityPlan` contract models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares, with an annual distribution of 250 shares over four years for a single employee.
